The group meeting was held on 13/07/2019 from 6:30 to 7:00 at SIM Blk B. As it was the first time all group members were meeting each other, everyone introduced themselves. We discussed about everybody’s experiences and shared information that can be useful for the project. We discussed about the requirements that the project might have. We exchanged contact details and decided to research about the topic until the next group meeting. The project also required a Manager/Team leader. I voted myself to be the team leader and got elected. Later I created the Whatsapp group, Onedrive folder and GitHub repository for the project. 

During this week, I researched the topic and development methodologies, how websites work, how the websites are created, what programming languages are used, what development tools are best for our project etc. 
`}{week1}{`
An informal group meeting was held online on 18/07/2019. We discussed each other’s findings. We discussed the advantages and disadvantages of some softwares like AWS, React, GitHub, etc. We also discussed about the software development methodologies and tools that can be appropriate for the project. At the end of the discussion we finalised to use React for our front end, AWS to support our backend, Github for our code repository. We also decided to use trello, figma to manage our project. At the end of this meeting, Zhiting created the gDoc for our project proposal and we planned to research about the products that are related to our project until our next meeting.

During this week, I researched on different products that are similar to our topic for the project. Of all the products I looked through, I selected Monster and Indeed to dive deeper and research in depth. I updated the same on whatsapp group and created an account on both websites. I used these websites extensively to notice the content, management and the User Experience of the website. Along with that, I researched more on these websites through their About Us page and other websites mentioning them and their details.

The group meeting was held on 27/07/2019 from 6:30 to 8:00 at SIM Blk B. We discussed about the products each of us selected. In my case, it was Monster and Indeed. We compared the websites and discussed about their features, speciality, user experience(UX) and design. We also discussed what features can be added in our project and what more can be improved. At the end of the discussion, we decided to report our findings in the project plan until the next meeting.

During this week, I wrote my findings in the Proposal document.
`}{week3}{`
An informal group meeting was held online on 02/08/2019. During this meeting, we discussed our next step. We discussed the basic structure for our project. We discussed the UML diagrams we require for the project.
During this week, we divided the team into subgroups to design the prototype. I decided to team up with Joshua to do use-case diagram for the prototype. All the sub groups worked closely to come up with the designs required for the prototype.
`}{week4}{`
The group meeting was held on 08/08/2019 from 6:30 till 7:30 at SIM Blk B. During this conversation, we discussed about the project progress. We needed more time with the diagrams and research, so we ended the meeting early and decided to focus on the planning for the prototype.
During this week as well, we planned the prototype and designed diagrams related to the prototype for the project.
`}{week5}{`
At this point, we have the content for our first draft. We decided that each team member will update the proposal with the final content appropriately and a final informal meeting was set up online before the submission at 17/08/2019 to finish the first draft, do some touch up, create the final version 1.0 for the proposal and submit as an initial draft. At the end of this meeting after submission, we decided to research about the areas of the project that is needed to be developed for the prototype.
Later this week, I researched more about React, AWS, Bootstrap, etc. so that I can discuss about the parts I wanted to do for the prototype in the project in the next meeting. 
`}{week6}{`
The group meeting was held on 20/08/2019 at SIM Blk B from 6:30 till 8:00. We discussed about the parts we wanted to develop for the project. We divided the team into subgroups to develop different sections of the prototype. I teamed up with Joshua to develop the front-end of the student side for the prototype. At the end of the meeting, we decided to research about the softwares and languages appropriate for our part in the prototype.
During this week, I targeted to learn basics for React before next meeting. I signed up for a Udemy ‘React’ course. I followed youtube tutorial and created some basic applications to get an overall understanding of React basics and how it works.
`}{week7}{`
An informal group meeting was held on 31/08/2019 where we discussed about the things we are trying to learn, understand and how it is important for the project.
